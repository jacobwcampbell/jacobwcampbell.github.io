<p>I am a 20 year old BSC+MSC Computer Science Student currently Studying at <a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/">The University of Sheffield</a>.</p>

<h2 id="university">University</h2>
<p>I have currently finished my second year, and have achieved an overall first in both years. I am going into my third year, then an industrial placement (TBD), then an integrated masters degree.</p>
<p>Please see my <a href="./modules">modules page</a> for more information about what I have studied so far.</p>
<h2 id="sixth-form">Sixth Form</h2>
<p>At Ashton Sixth Form College, I achieved A* A* A A A* in the following A Levels: Maths, Computer Science, Further Maths, Economics and EPQ (respectively).</p>
<p>Whilst in College, I  took part in the brillant <a href="https://oxnet.org">Oxnet</a> programme as well as the <a href="https://amsp.org.uk">AMSP</a> university admission programme, both of which I am highly grateful for.</p>
<h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
<h2 id="student-ambassador">Student Ambassador</h2>
<p>I have worked in roles for the Central University, Faculty of Engineering and School of Computer Science. This work is mainly focused on University Open Days.</p>
<p>All of these roles involve communicating with and helping prospective students (pre applicants and offer holders) and their families.</p>
<p>In addition, I have spoke at several of the School of Computer Science welcome talks and Q+A, which requires public speaking (audience size of approx 70 people).</p>
<h2 id="levelling-up-tutor">Levelling Up Tutor</h2>
<p>I am currently working as an A-Level Maths Tutor for the Sheffield node of the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/maths-tutoring-scheme-can-help-students-into-computer-science-degrees-says-professional-body-for-it/">BCS Levelling Up Scheme</a>.</p>
<p>This involves running sprints of weekly sessions, teaching A-Level Maths problems online to 6 students. This will continue into the next academic year.</p>
<h2 id="private-tutoring">Private Tutoring</h2>
<p>I am currently privately tutoring 4 hours a week of A Level Computer Science. This is subject to change throughout the year and I am always open to discussion of potential tuition (A Level).</p>
<h2 id="uk-cyberteam">UK Cyberteam</h2>
<p>Thoughout late 2024-early 2025 I competed in the <a href="https://ukcyberteam.sans.org">UK Cyber Team</a> competition, where I made it to the final stage. This involved two online rounds of CTF&rsquo;s followed by an in person CTF of the top 200 players (NEC Birmingham). Unfortunately I was not picked for the UK Team, however I intend to enter the next competition.</p>
<h1 id="personal-projects-coming-soon">Personal Projects (COMING SOON)</h1>
<p>I am currently in the process of looking through old projects, university projects and planning some new ones to work on.</p>
<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>
<p>The skills section on this page currently feels generic, and I would value any feedback regarding this. On a personal note, I would say my biggest skill is a genuine drive to just learn and continuously improve.</p>
