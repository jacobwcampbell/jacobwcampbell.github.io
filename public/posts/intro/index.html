  <p>Recently, I created this site with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. I have been quite interested in static sites, the <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">small web</a> and the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a> for a while, and was aware that my previous site was quite outdated.</p>
<p>As mentioned, I used Hugo to make this site, and have found it to be very pleasant to work with. I have only explored the tip of the iceberg and I imagine that there is a lot more to come. I also want to start learning Go, so this is a good opportunity.</p>
<p>The CSS is custom written, and inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/blob/master/themes/doom-one-theme.el">Doom One</a> theme for Emacs. I will consider creating a Hugo theme in the future, if it is requested.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no JavaScript, and I intend to keep the site 100% usable without it. I have nothing against JavaScript (I am actually playing around with Next.js at the moment), however it is not needed here! In addition, there are no analytics. Rendering of math equations is done on the backend.</p>
<p>Finally, I expect to make quite a few changes to the site in the following months regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minifying files (including image compression)</li>
<li>Adding more sections (possibly book reviews)</li>
<li>Improving accessibility (currently following standard principles but I would like to be more rigorous)</li>
</ul>
