# About Me
I am a 20 year old BSC+MSC Computer Science Student currently Studying at [The University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/).

# Education
## University
I have currently finished my second year, and have achieved an overall first in both years. I am going into my third year, then an industrial placement (TBD), then an integrated masters degree.

Please see my [modules page](./modules) for more information about what I have studied so far.
## Sixth Form
At Ashton Sixth Form College, I achieved A* A* A A A* in the following A Levels: Maths, Computer Science, Further Maths, Economics and EPQ (respectively).

Whilst in College, I  took part in the brillant [Oxnet](https://oxnet.org) programme as well as the [AMSP](https://amsp.org.uk) university admission programme, both of which I am highly grateful for.
# Experience
## Student Ambassador
I have worked in roles for the Central University, Faculty of Engineering and School of Computer Science. This work is mainly focused on University Open Days.

All of these roles involve communicating with and helping prospective students (pre applicants and offer holders) and their families. 

In addition, I have spoke at several of the School of Computer Science welcome talks and Q+A, which requires public speaking (audience size of approx 70 people).
## Levelling Up Tutor
I am currently working as an A-Level Maths Tutor for the Sheffield node of the [BCS Levelling Up Scheme](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/maths-tutoring-scheme-can-help-students-into-computer-science-degrees-says-professional-body-for-it/).

This involves running sprints of weekly sessions, teaching A-Level Maths problems online to 6 students. This will continue into the next academic year.
## Private Tutoring
I am currently privately tutoring 4 hours a week of A Level Computer Science. This is subject to change throughout the year and I am always open to discussion of potential tuition (A Level).
## UK Cyberteam
Thoughout late 2024-early 2025 I competed in the [UK Cyber Team](https://ukcyberteam.sans.org) competition, where I made it to the final stage. This involved two online rounds of CTF's followed by an in person CTF of the top 200 players (NEC Birmingham). Unfortunately I was not picked for the UK Team, however I intend to enter the next competition.
# Personal Projects (COMING SOON)
I am currently in the process of looking through old projects, university projects and planning some new ones to work on.

The skills section on this page currently feels generic, and I would value any feedback regarding this. On a personal note, I would say my biggest skill is a genuine drive to just learn and continuously improve.
